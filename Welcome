    Hey guys, this is Alex.
    I'm looking at the assignment info for the next step.  
    Zac hasn't mentioned if we will be getting an extension on part 4.
    Since this is an ongoing project anyways, I'm thinking we will get things started.  
    I'm taking a day off today from moving (finally got all 
        our furniture moved over) so I can work on homework and keep ahead.
    I plan on setting up our class files today and I'll post below in this file when I have done so, 
        and I will include some divvying up of who should do which classes.
    I hope your breaks are going well!
---Alex
