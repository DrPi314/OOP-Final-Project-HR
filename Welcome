hey every body is me. Abshir

Alex:
    Hey guys, this is Alex.
    I'm looking at the assignment info for the next step.  
    Zac hasn't mentioned if we will be getting an extension on part 4.
    Since this is an ongoing project anyways, I'm thinking we will get things started.  
    I'm taking a day off today from moving (finally got all 
        our furniture moved over) so I can work on homework and keep ahead.
    I plan on setting up our class files today and I'll post below in this file when I have done so, 
        and I will include some divvying up of who should do which classes.
    I hope your breaks are going well!

Alex:
    Instead of divvying up myself, I'll let you two pick the package you want to focus on.
    I will take the Finances Package.
    To get to the files you want to edit, click HR_Toolkit, then source, and the package folders will be there.
    The two other packages are Employee and Demographic.
    You can post here which one you choose so we all know who plans to work on which package.
    Sorry for the delay, I was having trouble figuring out how to post an existing directory to an existing repository.
    Thanks!
